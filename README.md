# k-d tree and range tree - Python

This is a project for the Multidimensional Data Structures course, [CEID](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) University of Patras.

## Description ⚡

Python implementation of k-d tree and range tree (+fractional cascading).
The target is to make multidimensional queries fast using these data structures.
The **airports.csv** file from https://ourairports.com/data/ was used.

## Visualization 👁️
Flask was used for the backend and the Mapbox API for the frontend. In the following screenshot, a 2D range query is sent to the backend with the coordinates of Greece's borders as arguments. This results in creating a marker for each Greek airport.
